### How to play:

Use WASD or arrow keys to move around (w = up, a = left, s = down, d = right).

Hold the SHIFT key to run.

Hold SPACE to do watering can animation.

To move the farmer around, use the IJKL keys (i = up, j = left, k = down, l = right). This character will not be controlled by the player in future developments, but this allows us to test the animations.

Hold ENTER key to shoot.

Press F1 to toggle the debug view, which shows object information. e.g. blue = collision radius, red = sprite size, white text is the sprite name and frame number of the animation currently displayed.
