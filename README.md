### How to play:

Use WASD or arrow keys to move around (w = up, a = left, s = down, d = right).

Hold the SHIFT key to run.

Press SPACE to do watering can animation.

Press F1 to toggle the debug view, which shows object information. e.g. blue = collision radius, red = sprite size, white text is the sprite name and frame number of the animation currently displayed.
